# Maker Skill Trees

A repository of Maker Skill Trees and templates to make your own.  Color in the boxes and level up your skills.  Use the template to track your progess and inspire you to try new things.  Use for individuals or as a group by each picking a color and coloring in part of the box.  Everyone's journey is different and you can interpret the goals flexibly.  Not everything needs to be completed.  Print your own, best sized at A3 to hang on the wall.  

Each skill tree has 73 skill or experience hexagonal tiles, ordered in a spectrum of basic skills at the bottom to more advanced skills at the top.  This includes 5 set your own goal tiles for you to tailor to your own interests. Released under the Creative Commons Licence, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  You are free to share, adapt, remix or transform the printables or templates.  However, you must do so by giving credit to Steph Piper / Maker Queen (or leaving the credit at the bottom of the page) and if you release a remix it must be under the same licence.

# How to Make Your Own

My aim with the skill trees is be: 
- flexible with goals rather than too specific, everyone's journey is different
- Inspiring to try new things rather than completionist
- Include options for tools that aren't cost / availability restrictive

With a total of 73 skill tiles, there's a lot of boxes to fill in!  To help prompt ideas, I usually include the following:
- What's the first few things you do in this skill?
- What materials might you use at a basic / intermediate / advanced level?
- What tools might you use at a basic / intermediate / advanced level?
- What techniques might you use at a basic / intermediate / advanced level?
- What might go wrong and how would you fix it?
- Where might you visit to learn more / get involved in a community?
- What interskill / interdisciplinary techniques could you try? Eg. Electronics + Textiles = Wearable Tech
- Gifting a friend something made from x skill
- Teaching a class on x skill
- Releasing an online tutorial on x skill
